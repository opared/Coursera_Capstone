How different are the metro stations in the city?

I born and raise in a little city in Venezuela, when I grow up 
I moved to Caracas and always preferred to travel into the city
along with the metro, I barely used the bus to get to my destiny.
I noticed that outside of many stations looks similarly. 
Now I live in Santiago de Chile and I still use a lot the metro
and still notice the similarities between some stations. 
With foursquare, it is possible to get data and compare the station 
and establish clusters and check how similar are them. 
This clustering could help to clasify the stations and improve 
the location for new stores or classify the zone with this information
