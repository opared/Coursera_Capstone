How different are the metro stations in the city?

I born and raise in a little city in Venezuela, when I grow up 
I moved to Caracas and always preferred to travel into the city
along with the metro, I barely used the bus to get to my destiny.
I noticed that outside of many stations looks similarly. 
Now I live in Santiago de Chile and I still use a lot the metro
and still notice the similarities between some stations. 


 knowing which are the similar stations it could be used to:

-establish a profile for the people who use the metro station, 
with this it could offer publicity campaign specific for each kind of stations
 
-Establish what clusters are the best place for a new store.

-The tourist agencies could use this information to offered low-cost routes 
focusing on the most attractive and comfortable places  nearby metro stations

-Compare two cities  let it to compare urban planning policies, it will be
 useful to improve it


With foursquare, it is possible to get data and compare the station 
and establish clusters and check how similar are them. 
This clustering could help to clasify the stations and improve 
the location for new stores or classify the zone with this information
