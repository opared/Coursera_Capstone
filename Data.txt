For the sake of our studying, I'll take positions for the metro station from 
Caracas Venezuela and Santiago de Chile, the station name's will be taken 
from the Wikipedia page for the metro using the name of the station is possible 
to get the coordinates from the geocoder package. With this, I'll get the nearby
venues from Foursquare, and with that, I could compare the stations and clustering.
